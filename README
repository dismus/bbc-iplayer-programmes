BBC iplayer to /programmes switching bookmarklet
=================================================

Inspired by the BBC /music - MusicBrainz bookmarklet, I created this to let you switch between a BBC /iplayer page and it's corresponding /programmes page. Why would you do this? The iplayer page has higher resolution video and is easier to discover other programmes whilst the /programmes listing includes better metadata and let's you see other episodes in the series.
